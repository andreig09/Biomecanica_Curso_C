\section{Algorithm description}\label{implementacion}
A system of motion capture with the characteristics necessary to meet the objective of this project must implement four general blocks: 
\emph{calibration}, \emph{segmentation}, \emph{reconstruction} y \emph{tracking}. In Figure \ref{bloquesSist} shows a scheme of the system to be implemented, every green block indicates the output of one stage being at the same time the input of the next block.

It is important to highlight the independence between blocks, allowing you to modify or easily optimize the system in future stages.
